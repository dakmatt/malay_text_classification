# malay_text_classification
A description notebook on the text_classification

Based on my understanding on the differentiation between ML and NLP, one of the main differences is that NLP use corpus and ML does not used corpus. 

There are limited Malay corpus available free to download. Hence, I saw that one of the possible way is to do deep learning(type of ML) to be explored to help in the text classification. When I did the text classification for Malay, I translate the words into English and got around 65% of accuracy. 

Kindly find the python jupyter notebook for your to download.
