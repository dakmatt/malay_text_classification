# malay_text_classification
A description notebook on the text_classification

Based on my understanding on the differentiation between ML and NLP, one of the main differences is that NLP use corpus and ML does not used corpus. 

However, there are several distinction between ML and NLP techniques. NLP requires Malay corpus and what I understand from several university in Malaysia, there are not much building the Malay Corpus. I remember a lecturer try to talk to Dewan Bahasa and Pustaka(DBP) to have access to the corpus and not successful. If you come across any entities who have build Malay corpus, kindly let me know since I'm interested to have collaboration either academically or commercially.

ML also has a problem too. We have to prepare the training set manually, in order to train the model to understand the data. 
The more training set , is the better the accuracy of the model. 

Hence, I thought of possible way is to do deep learning(type of ML) to be explored to help in the text classification. 

For this example, we have manual small set of training for text classification for Malay, I translate the words into English and got around 65% of accuracy. 

Kindly find the python jupyter notebook for your to download. 

Thank you,
Fairuz,
